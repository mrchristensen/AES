# AES

## How to Run the Code
Simply run the main.py file and it will guide your through encryption and decryption.  It prompts the user to decide between encryption, decryption, or exiting the program (with protection for incorrect input).  It then asked for the required information and returns the resulting output.

## Resources Used
I only used the approved resources listed in the project spec.  Mainly:
* [FIPS Publication 197](https://cs465.byu.edu/static/pubs/fips-197.pdf])
* [Wikipedia AES Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)

## Tests
All tests in Appendix C of the [FIPS Publication 197](https://cs465.byu.edu/static/pubs/fips-197.pdf]) pass (as well as many unit tests in tests.py)
